## Introduction

Welcome to todo-backend, a backend service developed with NestJS. This project provides a powerful API for managing to-do lists, featuring secure authentication and data storage. User authentication is handled via Auth0, ensuring that only authenticated users can interact with their personal to-do lists.

The application connects to a PostgreSQL database, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete their to-do tasks with persistent storage. Each userâ€™s to-do list is securely stored and isolated, ensuring that users can only access their own data. The backend is built using modern NestJS practices, providing scalability, maintainability, and performance.
